## Hi there, I am Rubens ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a physicist who recently discovered I have great interest in all areas of data science. I have always had a strong passion for learning and teaching.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently educating myself in the following areas: Machine Learning, Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Probability and Deep learning.

- ðŸŒ± In addition to furthering my research, I am presently working on the registration of a computer program called the [ExtraGalactic Cosmic-Ray Propagator (EGCRProp)](https://pos.sissa.it/301/477/pdf) that I created during my Ph.D. studies.

- ðŸ“– I also love writing! That's why I created the [Statictics Soup](https://rubensjrcosta.github.io/) blog.
